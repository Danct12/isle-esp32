# LEGO Island port for ESP32
An attempt at getting the [portable version](https://github.com/isledecomp/isle-portable) of LEGO Island on ESP32-family microcontrollers.

You'll need at least 8 MB PSRAM, a display module and an SD card module (to store the game and save files) for this to work.

(doesn't work as of now)
